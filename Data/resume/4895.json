In America, there\u2019re a lot of turbines \nthat need to be tracked, monitored to check whether any issues occurred. In WFM, for example we used the \nTimeSeries service that provided by GE Predix Platform to do the tracking or monitoring data that pushed by \nsensors.

SISTIC\u2019s \nAuthorised Agents are located in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand. \n\u2022 \nThe project consists of 3 parts, a booking engine network, a main backend application and an ACS (Access \nControl System) network. The architecture is just simple, 3 parts are communicated with each other via \nSOAP/RESTful services (SOAP is for back-compatible functionalities).  \n\u2022 \nEnd users can do the booking directly on the web. They can choose seats visually; choose the promotion price, \nexpected delivery, payment methods and ticket protector etc. \n\u2022 \nVenue, seat map, price, delivery methods, all of the things can be configured in the backend application and \nserving to booking engine apps via RESTful services. \n\u2022 \nNew business will be configured in properties file for adhoc deployments. \nTechnologies Used: \n\u2022 \nProgramming languages and frameworks: \no Java, JSP/Servlet, Spring 4, Spring MVC 4, Hibernate 4, Struts 1.2, Jasper Report 4.6.1, Quartz, Log4j, \nApache POI, HTML, CSS, Jquery \no Web Services: SOAP, REST. \n\u2022 \nDeployment server: \no Websphere 8, Tomcat 7. \n\u2022 \nTest \no JUnit. \no SoapUI, REST Advanced Client for testing web services. \nJan 2013 \u2013 June 2014 \nSenior Java Developer at FPT Software Danang \nClient: HITACHI \nProject: Population Management \nI\u2019m responsible for: \n\u2022 \nUsing design patterns, best practices and common usage, build abstract classes as well as interfaces for project \nteam. \n\u2022 \nConduct a daily meeting \n\u2022 \nCompose/modify common documents (convention docs, business docs, comment docs) \n\u2022 \nWeb meeting with BrSE to clear requirement \n\u2022 \nBe a member of team lead meetings to solve difficult issues \n\u2022 \nDo a super review for deliverables. \n\u2022 \nSupport project team members for technical issues. \n\u2022 \nDo unit test before merge the code into SVN for deliverables. \n\u2022 \nCreate assistant documents (time management, issue management, bug trends management, quality \nmanagement, resources management) \nProject descriptions \n\u2022 \nThis project is a migration project.
