BRE gets \nresponsibility to evaluate/compute the business rules. For example: to calculate the tax for weekly \nbenefit bases on the Tax Scale, to calculate the compensation money for weekly benefit, to evaluate \nthe set of condition rules to generate the tasks for NCMM (National Case Management Model), to \nevaluate/ validate all the business rules of the insurance business domain. To build the BRE, we use \nthe WF as the core engine. We compose the rule definitions as flowchart, sequential and call the WF \nto evaluate the rules and return the set of dictionary result. For complicated rules, we use the BizTalk. \nBecause of using BizTalk is to evaluate the rules with input up to thousand claims data as xml format, \nevaluate the NCMM input to escalate the task to high manager. Expose the BRE as service (WCF) to \nintegrate with another applications. \no Task Factory: the system manages to create tasks for multiple applications. We support to create \nmultiple tasks such as: the NCMM tasks (tasks to remind the case manager to process the claim with \ni\ufffdjury \ufffdorker: \ufffd day a\ufffdtio\ufffd pla\ufffd, 3 \ufffdeek strategy pla\ufffd, \ufffd \ufffdeek strategy pla\ufffd,\u2026\ufffd.

To create the tasks \nbases on schedule, we implement the window service to run in the background. At the mid-night, the \nservice will be run to create tasks and assigns the tasks to case managers and escalate the task to \nhigher manager. \no Pivotal: this is the main application (the claim management system - web application).
