I don\u2019t intend to talk a lot of myself in Cover Letter (You could take a look at \nmy CV for more details). I would like to focus on only one opinion of mine: \u201cSometimes, you should \ntry something new. Not because new one is sure to be better, but because you will have a new \nchoice and you can chose a better one for yourself\u201d. \n    I\u2019m delighted to talk about one of the biggest decisions of my life. I had lived in Hanoi, Vietnam for \nmost of my time. Although, I really love Hanoi which become a part of my heart, but I had a decision \nto move to Saigon 1 year ago. In Hanoi, I had everything, e.g: a career, a family, friends\u2026 and I was \nalso familiar with the lifestyle and weather in Hanoi. To be honest, it was difficult for me to make this \ndecision. But I desired to change and knew that I really want to live in Saigon at least once in my \nlife. After 1 year in Saigon, I could spend whole day talking about the differences between Hanoi \nand Saigon. Shortly, Saigon is more powerful, more dynamic and more modern than Hanoi. In my \nhumble opinion, Saigon is better place to live. Finally, I decided that my family would settle in \nSaigon, and I would never regret it. \n    Another story from me! I am very good at concentrating on work, and I could work with high \nintensity for a whole day. But after that, I would come back home exhausted and was unable to \nrecovery for next working day. This problem is too serious. You know, the life is a marathon, not a \nsprint. So I had tried several methods, e.g: listening to music, pushing up, and even meditating... but \nI often forgot to take a break. Fortunately, my friend introduced Pomodoro Technique to me. Simply, \nit means: start focusing for 25 minutes, then take a break for 5 minutes and repeat it over and over. \nOne weakness of this approach is that sometimes my manager finds me not hard-working. But it\u2019s \nnot a big deal! This technique is not only simple, but also very effective for me to the extent that I \nhave kept this habit for more than 5 years. \n    As I said, new options are sometimes not as suitable to you as they are now. For example, I had \nbeen playing football from when I was a child. But 2 years ago, my leg was broken due to an football \naccident. I realized that football is quite dangerous, so I decided against playing football any more. I \nwent to swimming pool every weekend. Swimming is very good for your health and help you lose \nyour weight. But I was not gifted with swimming, and I missed football so much. Moreover, football is \na team sport, so that you can chat with your teammates after match. And above all, I love football, \ndeep in my heart. Finally, I decided to go back to football. \n    In summary, sometimes, keeping a habit for a long time is quite boring. We know that keeping the \nhabit is safer for you. But it's so interesting to try something new, you will have the opportunity to \nexperience the things you have never experienced. And even if the new one does not suit you, you \ncan still return to the original choice. Please, bear in mind that: \"More risk, more profit\". \n   Thank you for reading! \nNovember, 2018 \nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)", "educations": [{"id": 4600, "gpa": "7.6", "major": "C\u00f4ng ngh\u1ec7 th\u00f4ng tin", "school": "Posts & Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT)", "diploma": "Other", "end_time": null, "conf_score": 0.8300731565898793, "start_time": null, "picklist_major": "IT - Hardware/Networking", "major_categories": "M\u00e1y t\u00ednh v\u00e0 c\u00f4ng ngh\u1ec7 th\u00f4ng tin", "major_categories_detail": "C\u00f4ng ngh\u1ec7 th\u00f4ng tin"}], "experiences": [{"id": 15355, "detail": "", "company": "Message Media", "end_time": "2023-04-13T00:00:00Z", "industry": "Other", "position": "Principal Java Developer", "conf_score": 0.7229737961582939, "start_time": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15356, "detail": "", "company": "VnDirect", "end_time": "2017-11-30T00:00:00Z", "industry": "Other", "position": "Java Team Leader", "conf_score": 0.8888931379457348, "start_time": "2016-05-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15357, "detail": "", "company": "Niteco", "end_time": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z", "industry": "High Technology", "position": "Senior Android Developer", "conf_score": 0.8888931379457348, "start_time": "2015-04-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15358, "detail": "", "company": "OG Studio", "end_time": "2015-04-30T00:00:00Z", "industry": "Other", "position": "Java Team Leader", "conf_score": 0.8888931379457348, "start_time": "2013-12-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15359, "detail": "", "company": "Wala", "end_time": "2013-12-31T00:00:00Z", "industry": "Other", "position": "Java Team Leader", "conf_score": 0.8722560153087423, "start_time": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15360, "detail": "", "company": "VNG (Vinagame)", "end_time": "2012-07-31T00:00:00Z", "industry": "High Technology", "position": "Android Team Leader", "conf_score": 0.8888931379457348, "start_time": "2010-10-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15361, "detail": "", "company": "Viettel\nR&D department", "end_time": "2010-09-30T00:00:00Z", "industry": "High Technology", "position": "IT employee", "conf_score": 0.8888931379457348, "start_time": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z"}, {"id": 15362, "detail": "", "company": "Ekabiz", "end_time": "2010-01-31T00:00:00Z", "industry": "Other", "position": "Programmer", "conf_score": 0.8989127330770028, "start_time": "2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}], "address": "District 4, Hcm city, Vietnam"}
