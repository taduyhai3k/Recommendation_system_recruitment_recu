There were large apps \nrequiring decent architecture and well-organised code in order to be sustainably developed and \nmaintained. \nCommunication skill, determination and dedication are what allow me to successfully fulfill my \nresponsibilities and produce results at high quality. \nSKILLS \nWeb Development Languages \nC#, ASP.NET MVC, WCF, LINQ, Entity Framework, Web API \nJavascript, Angular, VueJS, ReactJS, RxJS, jQuery, HTML, CSS \nNodeJS, Express, Sequelize  \nMobile Development Languages \nAndroid native, Xamarin, Nativescript \nArchitectural / design patterns \nMVC, MVVM, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Gang of Four, Redux  \nDevelopment principles \nSOLID, DDD, SOA, Microservices \nDatabase \nMSSQL, PostgreSQL \nDevelopment Tools \nVisual Studio, Android Studio, Git, Azure DevOps, JIRA \nOthers \nERP \nEXPERIENCE \nSenior developer \nAugen Software Group, HCMC, Vietnam \nApr 2017 \u2013 Present (2 years) \nThe product was a SPA web app for a car rental company. It adopted Vue / Vuex as the front-end \nframework and the team was happy for that decision. We was able to utilize it as a component-based \nframework, its flexibility in template binding, its capability of composing a new component by mixing \nsmaller components together, and finally ES6. The back end was built as separate services with an API \ngateway, though it was still in a monolithic manner, it was maintainable and scalable.  \nMy responsibilities: \n- \nInvolved in the architectural decision making as the project kicked off \n- \nWas responsible for framework development and maintenance \n- \nCode review, code refactoring \n- \nDeveloped features as per requirements \n- \nWrote unit tests for critical areas \nTechnologies involved: C#, Web API, Vue / Vuex, Azure Storage \nDevelopment Team Lead \nBrand Developers Limited, HCMC, Vietnam  \nNovember 2012 \u2013 November 2015 (3 years) \nThe product was a Warehouse Management SPA web app helping user record their activities in \nwarehouse, i.e. purchase order, receiving, shipping, cycle count... It adopted Angular JS (aka Angular 1) \nwhich was an emerging innovative Javascript framework back then, Angular\u2019s powerful two-way binding \nand the capability of writing reusable components allowed the team to build a solid front-end framework, \nthus escalated the development pace. On the back end, it adopted DDD as the development methodology, \nso that multiple teams could work independently within different bounded contexts. It used Greg Young \nEvent Store as the Event Sourcing technique, also as a message bus to communicate between aggregates. \nIt used CQRS to separate read & write, so that a NoSQL database could be leveraged for read optimization. \nMy responsibilities: \n- \nManaged a small development team in VN to collaborate with NZ team in backlog refinement and \nproblem solving  \n- \nWas accountable for front-end framework development and maintenance \n- \nDeveloped features as per requirements \nTechnologies involved: C#, Raven, AngularJS, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing \nSoftware Developer \nBYS Joint Stock Company, HCMC, Vietnam \nSep 2009 \u2013 November 2012 (3 year 2 months) \nThe product was an ERP desktop app for local enterprises comprising multiple modules, each module \nrepresents a group of activities of the enterprise, i.e. sale, purchase, warehousing, accounting. It had a \nrobust framework which allowed to develop features quickly and efficiently. It built a lightweight ORM \nlayer on its own with the intent of getting a full control over data access.
