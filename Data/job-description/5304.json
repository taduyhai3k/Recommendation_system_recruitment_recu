{"title": "Big Data Engineer (Java)", "description": "# Big Data Engineer\n- What if every software engineer could hold 1 billion lines of code in their head? \n- How would it change the way we build software? \n- How would it accelerate our innovations for the rest of the world?\n\nQuod AI aims to create the first AI assistant for software engineering team. Our first product translates raw source code into natural language to help software engineering team manage the complexity of large codebase. To do this, we apply NLP and Deep Learning onto more than 1 billion lines of code.\n\n### Key Responsibilities\n- Work with fellow engineers and data scientists to develop and maintain our core product.\n- Implement our data pipelines (Java, Elasticsearch, Redis, Apache Beam).\n- Work on the implementation of new features, leaving things properly implemented, well documented and delivered on time.\n- Always be on the lookout for opportunities to create and improve. From our development process, up to final user\u2019s experiences.", "requirements": "- Solid skills and 3+ years experience with Java. \n- Solid understanding of databases.\n-  Enjoy challenging projects involving big data sets.\n- Relevant experience with Google Cloud or AWS.\n- Superior analytical, conceptual and problem-solving skills.\n- The ability to learn and iterate quickly.\n- An obsession with agile and lean principles (GitHub, Trello).", "required_skills": ["github", "trello", "lean", "google cloud", "agile", "aws", "cloud", "problem solving", "java", "database", "problem solving skill"]}
